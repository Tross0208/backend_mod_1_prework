## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I have experienced trying to grow outside of my zone of proximal develop, and have learned first hand that it is typically not the best route to develop a skill.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I currently reflect on my skills, do not stress over mistakes (so long as they do not recur frequently), and actively seek challenges. I do not often set goals, and am slow to seek help.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A hash is a set of key-value pairs, and differs from an array in that it uses arbitrary objects in place of established data types.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = {"leashes": 20, "Bags of food": 40, "Puppies": 15}`

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states.values[1]`

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`p states.keys`
`p states.values`

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A hash could be used to store student information. This is better than an array because each index position can have a label (key) rather than just a value.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
I would like to know if there is an accepted convention when there are multiple ways to write a given operation.
