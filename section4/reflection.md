## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It felt better in some respects, worse in others. 25 minutes is too small a time for me, as it can take me a while to figure out where I left off.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
Setting intentions was effective. The intention was usually a very small task due to the time limit, and made it easy to focus on and track progress.

1. In your own words, what is a Class?
A class is a set of common qualities.

1. What is an attribute of a Class?
An attribute is a piece of data belonging to a class.

1. What is behavior of a Class?
A behavior is an action taken by or done to a class.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors:

```rb
class Dinner
  def initialize (food, beverage)
    @food = food
    @beverage = beverage
  end  

  def eat_food
    @food = false
  end

  def drink_beverage
    @beverage = false
  end
end      

```

1. How do you create an instance of a class?
`name_of_object = Class.new(attributes)`

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
